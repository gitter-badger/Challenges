Challenge Set 2
===
Problem One(Easy): Array Rotation
--------
The problem is to rotate a given array to the right by n steps.

For example: Given [1,2,3] and n=1, you should return [3,2,1]


Problem Two(Medium): Coin Change
--------
For the given value n, write a function that will find how many ways that one can make change for 
the given amount.


Problem Three(Tricky): Josephus Problem
--------
There are people standing in a circle waiting to be executed. The counting out begins at some point
in the circle and proceeds around the circle in a fixed direction. In each step, a certain number of 
people are skipped and the next person is executed. The elimination proceeds around the circle(which
is becoming smaller and smaller as the executed people are removed), until only the last person 
remains, who is given freedom.

The task is to choose the place in the initial circle so that you are the last one remaining and so
survive. Write a function for any number of people(n) you can use to ensure you are the victor every 
time.

Bonus: Figure out a formula to easily solve this and explain how you got to it.
